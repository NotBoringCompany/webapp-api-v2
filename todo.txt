- create generalConfig and config functions for frontend.
- create `getListingData` and other marketplace functions for `getGenesisNBMon`.
- make the alt versions of the genesisNBMon functions for Playfab obtaining.
- Create addToActivities, import to genesisNBMonMinting API
- Create uploadGenesisEggMetadata, import to genesisNBMonMinting API
- declare uploadGenesisEggMetadata and addToActivities in `publicMint`
- Create an emergency check for GenesisNBMons class in Moralis (just in case some minted NBMons are not added so that it can manually be added to the Moralis DB).
- Change hatching duration in `publicMint` for proper production.
- remove console.logs (later on)
- remove require dotenv and moralis imports from all fiels apart from server.js

- IMPORTANT: change genesis testing contract to genesis actual contract later on for the genesis contract declaration like in new ethers.Contract
and in `getGenesisNBMonOwner` etc where querying in Moralis is needed.
- IMPORTANT: Gaming Backend Repo needs to be changed with the changes in the new moralis db.
- IMPORTANT: security implementation for `uploadGenesisEggMetadata` as now anyone can just call and upload it.


IMPORTANT CHANGES FROM V1 BACKEND:
1. publicMint (genesisNBMonMinting) now accepts `toAddress` instead of `address` for clarity.
2. getGenesisNBMonOwner now accepts `id` instead of `nbmonId`.
3. getOwnerGenesisNBMons is now `getOwnedGenesisNBMons`.
4. getOwnerGenesisNBMonIDs is now `getOwnedGenesisNBMonIDs`.
5. getGenesisNBMonTypes is now converted into `getNBMonData` to retrieve not just the types of an NBMon but ALL data (and not just Genesis NBMons). It also accepts `genus` instead of `genusParam`.
6. getGenesisBehavior is now also obtained from `getNBMonData`.
7. specialAttackEffort and specialDefenseEffort from is now spAtkEffort and spDefEffort. Both are also obtained from `nbmonGameData` class, not `Genesis_NBMons_GameData`
