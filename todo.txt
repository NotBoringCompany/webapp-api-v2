- create getGenesisBehavior function and import in `getGenesisNBMon`.
- Create addToActivities, import to genesisNBMonMinting API
- Create uploadGenesisEggMetadata, import to genesisNBMonMinting API
- declare uploadGenesisEggMetadata and addToActivities in `publicMint`
- create genesisNBmonsGameData class in moralis and save the nbmon in this class after saving it to GenesisNBMons in the `publicMint` function
- Create an emergency check for GenesisNBMons class in Moralis (just in case some minted NBMons are not added so that it can manually be added to the Moralis DB).
- Change hatching duration in `publicMint` for proper production.
- IMPORTANT: change genesis testing contract to genesis actual contract later on for the genesis contract declaration like in new ethers.Contract
and in `getGenesisNBMonOwner` etc where querying in Moralis is needed.
- remove console.logs (later on)


IMPORTANT CHANGES FROM V1 BACKEND:
1. publicMint (genesisNBMonMinting) now accepts `toAddress` instead of `address` for clarity.
